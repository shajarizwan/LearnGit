<body lang="en-US" dir="ltr"><h1>Deliciousness in every bite!</h1>
<p>Every cookie made at the Kevin Cookie company is crafted with only
the purest ingredients. Butter from grass fed cows. Unbleached flour
with the best flavor and textures. Organic sugar only from India.
Eggs from chickens that are free range. Even our water is special. It
comes from the Cascade Mountain springs that we hike up to retrieve.
Baking is our passion and we take it very seriously.</p>
